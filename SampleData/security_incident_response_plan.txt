4. **Data Collection**:  
   - **Input**: Logs from Azure AD, Sentinel, and Defender.  
   - **Action**:  
     - Retrieve sign-in logs and correlate with anomalies.  
     - Save artifacts to **Azure Blob Storage**.  
   - **Output**: Centralized evidence repository.

5. **Analysis**:  
   - **Input**: Collected evidence.  
   - **Action**:  
     - Investigate suspicious files using **Defender ATP Sandbox**.  
     - Correlate incidents using KQL queries.  
   - **Output**: Root cause report.

### **3. Containment**  
**Objective**: Limit the incident's spread and impact.

1. **Short-Term Containment**:  
   - **Input**: Affected devices or user accounts.  
   - **Action**:  
     - Isolate devices using **Defender for Endpoint**:  
       ```powershell
       Invoke-MpWDOScan -ScanType Full
       ```  
     - Block malicious IPs in **Defender Firewall**.  
     - Use the **Incident Enrichment plugin** to identify related alerts for the incident and adjust containment measures accordingly.  
   - **Output**: Isolated and mitigated threats.

2. **Communication**:  
   - **Input**: Stakeholder contact list.  
   - **Action**: Notify stakeholders via **Microsoft Teams**.  
   - **Output**: Communication log in **Azure DevOps**.

3. **Incident Scope Assessment**:  
   - **Input**: Logs from affected systems.  
   - **Action**: Use advanced hunting to assess the attackâ€™s entry point and affected assets.  
   - **Output**: List of impacted users and systems.
