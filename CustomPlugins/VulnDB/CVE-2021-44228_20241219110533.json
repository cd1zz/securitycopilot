            "description": "Apache Log4j contains a flaw in the JndiManager::lookup() function in log4j-core/src/main/java/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/net/JndiManager.java. The issue is triggered when handling JNDI lookups as the types of protocols used or hosts and classes accessed via LDAP are not restricted. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.",
            "solution": "It has been reported that this has been fixed. Please refer to the product listing for upgraded versions that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, pattern layout lookups within message text can be disabled by setting the \"formatMsgNoLookups\" option to \"true\". Please note that this option is only available in version 2.10.0 and later.\r\n\r\nPlease note that while the vendor addressed the reported vulnerability in version 2.15.0, version 2.15.1 was released to disable JNDI access by default, which did not actually fix the vulnerability (i.e. attackers could trivially exploit using other methods). A more comprehensive fix has been released in version 2.16.0 where the problematic message lookups functionality has been removed. Customers not requiring JNDI access or message lookups are strongly encouraged to update to version 2.16.0 or newer.",

            "t_description": "Note: Library/framework vulnerability. This code is used in a wide variety of software and the issue may manifest in a number of different ways. Depending on the implementation, it will vary if this vulnerability requires local access, or if it may be exploited remotely.\r\n\r\nExploitation requires that an attacker can control the string being logged.\r\n\r\nThere are reports of this actively being exploited in the wild against Minecraft. According to Greynoise, over 100 hosts, primarily Tor exit nodes, have been detected attempting to exploit this.\r\n\r\nSome sources incorrectly refer to this vulnerability as CVE-2021-4438 or CVE-2021-44248 instead of CVE-2021-44228.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the vendor has mitigated the issue by restricting protocols that can be used via an JNDI lookup by default and limiting classes and LDAP hosts. The affected JNDI lookup code may still be triggered when non-default configurations are used. Bug report LOG4J2-3210 suggests that some of the restrictions may not be effective.\r\n\r\nThe Elasticsearch vendor advisories are poorly written and contradictory. It begins by saying Elasticsearch is \"not susceptible to remote code execution with this vulnerability due to our use of the Java Security Manager\". However, it later says 5.0.0+ is affected, 6 and 7 are not, but concludes by saying that users should upgrade to the latest version and/or reinstalling stackpacks \"which have been patched to include the JVM option mitigation.\" Based on this messy and convoluted advisory, we believe it is safer to assume your Elasticsearch instance is likely vulnerable and upgrading is recommended.\r\n\r\nRed Hat assigned CVE-2021-4104 to a log4j issue, covered by VulnDB 276252, that represents a vulnerability dependent weakness requiring significant access to effect local code execution affecting 1.x. CVE-2021-45046 was assigned to represent the \"incomplete fix\" in 2.15.1 for the issue represented in this entry. The vendor has definitively said that log4j 1.x \"does NOT offer a JNDI look up mechanism at the message level, it does NOT suffer from CVE-2021-44228.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to researchers, the incomplete fix (designated CVE-2021-45046) \"only applies in certain non-default configurations\" and currently \"remote code execution has been demonstrated on macOS - not reproducible in other test environments\".\r\n\r\nOn 2021-12-16, Red Hat has assigned CVE-2021-4125 for an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.\r\n\r\nMany vendors mention upgrading Java to a specific version to \"fix\" this issue. This is a common misunderstanding that just because Java changed a default behavior (com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trusturlcodebaseset to 'false' instead of 'true'), it magically made this vulnerability irrelevant. That change does not address the vulnerability, it only blocks the LDAP exploitation vector using new untrusted codebases - not serialization type attacks using gadgets. It also doesn't protect against a slew of other exploit vectors. Upgrading Java does not \"fix\" the vulnerability or effectively stop anything except the most basic exploit vector involving LDAP-based attacks. Note that based on the version of the Java Manager installed, the vulnerability impacts may vary.\r\n\r\nNote that due to the way vendors include log4j over the years, there are many cases where an early version of software (e.g. 1.0 and 2.0) used log4j 1.x and were not vulnerable to this issue. Subsequent versions (e.g. 3.0 and 4.0) upgraded to use log4j 2.x and were vulnerable to this issue. Then the vendor fixed the issue by upgrading to log4j 2.17 in e.g. 4.1. In these cases, RBS is trying to capture this type of detail when possible. In this example, the software would be listed as 1.0, 2.0, and 4.1 as 'Not Affected' with versions 3.0 and 4.0 as 'Affected'.\r\n\r\nThe CVSS score for this entry has been updated to reflect adherence to the CVSS scoring guidelines. On the surface this appears to be a CVSSv2 10.0 / CVSSv3 10.0 issue, as reflected in NVD and briefly by RBS. In some scenarios this is an accurate score, in others they are not. However, scoring must be done based on Log4j and the context it runs in, not speculation on possible use-case scenarios. The base score reflects that, and CVSS environmental scores allow an organization to re-cast the score based on their specific environment. So if e.g. a web server is passing user-controlled content to the logs which are then forwarded to a logging host, that represents a scope change and would get scored MS:C. Since Log4j is a library, it would have to be configured / implemented in such a way as to allow user-controlled strings which warrants Access Complexity Medium (AC:M) for CVSSv2, leading to a 9.3 score. In this case, AC:M is used for just that and does not represent user interaction required, which is often what AC:M designates. As always for libraries, they can only be scored for that *one* product, the library itself. All the products bunding the library will be affected in a myriad of ways that result in different scores, and organizations will have to tweak those scores depending on their individual configurations. A re-based score may be derived for different business units or applications even, depending on the organization's security workflow.\r\n\r\nAmazon's AWS-2021-006 advisory says \"Amazon Chime SDK services have been updated to mitigate the issues identified in CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.\" RBS has clarified that Amazon Chime SDK for JavaScript (amazon-chime-sdk-js) is not impacted.\r\n\r\nAs of 2021-12-10, this is reported as being exploited in the wild. As of 2021-12-19, a Mirai-based variant using this vulnerability has been detected, allowing for the automatic propagation of the worm.\r\n\r\nCVE-2024-23049 represents an incorrect CVE assignment intended to represent Symphony's use of a vulnerable version of log4j, 2.11.1. As such, it has been included on this entry.",
