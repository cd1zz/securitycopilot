  DisplayName: ServiceNOW CVE & Software Inventory Search
  Description: |
    Azure Functions API for analyzing vulnerabilities and software inventory in ServiceNow.
    
    This API provides endpoints to:
    - Analyze individual CVEs and QIDs for vulnerable systems
    - Batch analyze multiple vulnerabilities
    - Search vulnerabilities by confirmation status
    - Query software inventory by manufacturer or product name
    
    All endpoints require authentication via API key in the X-API-Key header.
    
    ## LLM Usage Guidance
    
    When using this API through an LLM, focus on these primary metrics:
    
    **For Vulnerability Analysis:**
    - `statistics.total_vulnerable_systems` - The count of affected systems (primary impact metric)
    - `cvss_score` - Severity rating (9.0+ critical, 7.0+ high priority)
    - `systems[].assignment_group` - Teams responsible for remediation
    
    **For Software Inventory:**
    - `total_installations` - Deployment scale across environment
    - Version distribution - Identify outdated software requiring updates
    - `manufacturer` verification - Ensure correct vendor association
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Use `confirmation_state: "confirmed"` for actionable vulnerabilities
    - Set `fetch_all_details: false` for faster initial assessments
    - Leverage wildcards (*) in software searches for broader discovery
    - Focus on high CVSS scores AND high system counts for prioritization
