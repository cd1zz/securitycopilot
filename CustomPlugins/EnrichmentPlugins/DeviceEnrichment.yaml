          Executes a KQL query against DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment to evaluate Microsoft Defender antivirus signature status and real-time protection health across Windows, macOS, and Linux devices. This skill:
            1. **Tracks Signature Currency**: Compares current device signatures against latest available signatures per platform
            2. **Monitors Protection Status**: Identifies devices with inactive real-time protection
            3. **Cross-Platform Coverage**: Evaluates protection across Windows, macOS, and Linux endpoints
          This skill enables security teams to quickly identify devices with outdated signatures or disabled real-time protection that require immediate attention.
        Description: |-
          Analyzes Microsoft Defender antivirus signature status and real-time protection health using DeviceTvmSecureConfigurationAssessment data. Evaluates critical security components:
          
          - Signature Status:
            • Current device signature version
            • Latest available signature version for the platform
            • Last update timestamp
          - Protection Status:
            • GOOD: Real-time protection is active and functioning
            • BAD: Real-time protection is inactive or malfunctioning
          
          Results are filtered to show only devices requiring attention (outdated signatures or inactive protection), helping teams prioritize updates and fixes across Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

        DescriptionForModel: |-
          Executes a KQL query against DeviceEvents to analyze ASR rule compatibility with different Windows platforms. This skill:
            1. **Maps Platform Compatibility**: Shows which ASR rules are supported on which platforms
            2. **Identifies Platform-Specific Issues**: Highlights rules that may not be compatible with certain platforms
            3. **Enables Targeted Deployment**: Helps plan ASR rule enforcement based on platform distribution
          This skill is valuable for organizations with mixed Windows environments to understand compatibility constraints.
        Description: |-
          Analyzes ASR rule compatibility with different Windows platforms. Key insights include:
          
          - **Platform Compatibility Matrix**:
            • Shows which ASR rules are supported on which platforms
            • Identifies platform-specific compatibility issues
            
          - **Deployment Planning**:
            • Helps create platform-specific ASR policies
            • Prevents attempted enforcement of unsupported rules
            
          Results enable security teams to plan appropriate ASR policies for their specific Windows environment mix.
