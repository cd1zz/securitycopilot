## IPEnrichment Plugin
This suite of IP enrichment skills is designed to enhance security investigations by providing insights into IP-related activity. These tools help identify suspicious login attempts, detect brute force attacks, and analyze login anomalies associated with specific IP addresses.

### IdentifyFailedLoginIPs
Identify IP addresses with repeated failed login attempts across multiple accounts. Highlights IPs with suspicious activity patterns, such as brute force attacks or password spray attempts, and provides key metrics like the number of failed attempts and distinct accounts targeted.

Example Prompt: Identify IPs with more than 10 failed login attempts in the past 24 hours.
