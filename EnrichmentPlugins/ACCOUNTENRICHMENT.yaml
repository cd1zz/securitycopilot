        DisplayName: Unusual Sign-in Activity
        DescriptionForModel: |- 
          Performs a KQL query on the `SigninLogs` table to analyze the last 30 days of sign-in activity for a specified user. Key features include:
          - **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual login patterns such as:
            - High failure rates compared to successful sign-ins.
            - Sign-ins from unfamiliar or high-risk locations.
            - Sudden changes in devices, applications, or user agents.
          - **Detailed Insights**: Provides data on:
            - `IPAddress`: Location of the sign-in.
            - `DeviceDetail.deviceId`: Device used for the sign-in.
            - `UserAgent`: Client used for the session.
            - `ClientAppUsed` and `AppDisplayName`: Applications accessed.
          - **Summarization**: Includes the first observed sign-in, last observed sign-in, and counts of successful vs. failed attempts.
          - **Actionable Recommendations**: Suggests next steps such as password reset, MFA review, or security investigation for anomalies, while confirming consistent activity for normal patterns.
          This skill enables security analysts to detect and respond to potential sign-in threats effectively.
        Description: Identify unusual sign-in patterns for a specific user based on anomalies such as high-risk locations, login failures, and sudden changes in device, application, or IP address usage. Highlights deviations from normal behavior and provides recommendations for security actions.
